# Progress - Newstogram Project

**Date:** 5/12/2025

## Overview
This progress update summarizes the current state of the project after recent module refactoring and feature enhancements.

## Completed Features
- **Multi-Canvas Management:**  
  - Users can add multiple canvases with thumbnail navigation.
  - Each canvas has its own text editing controls and download functionality.
- **Module Refactoring:**  
  - JavaScript files have been refactored as ES6 modules:
    - `js/main.js` handles overall canvas management and global state.
    - `js/element.js` contains DOM and element manipulation logic.
    - `js/textEditor.js` manages text editing and styling functions.
    - `js/image.js` handles image fetching and background removal actions.
- **Background Removal:**  
  - Integrated background removal using `@huggingface/transformers` via CDN.
  - Custom loader messages have been implemented:
    - **"Model is loading, please wait..."** when the model is being initialized.
    - **"Removing background..."** during image processing.
    - **"Background removed"** upon successful completion.
- **User Interaction:**  
  - All primary buttons (Login, Create Post, etc.) are functioning as expected.
  - Enhanced error handling and messaging have been integrated for smoother UX.
- **API Integration:**  
  - Basic integration with backend endpoints for fetching news, image uploads, and member login.

## Next Steps
- Conduct further UI/UX refinements and thorough testing.
- Optimize error handling and code organization.
- Expand features in response to further user feedback.
- Finalize API integrations and deploy in a staging environment for broader testing.

## Remaining Tasks
- Refine error messages and feedback loops across modules.
- Continue improving module interactions and code performance.
- Update documentation as new features are implemented.
