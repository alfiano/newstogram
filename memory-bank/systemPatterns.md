# System Patterns

Newstogram5 adheres to a modular architecture with a clear separation between frontend and backend code. The frontend is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, promoting component reuse and maintainability. The backend API follows RESTful principles and leverages Node.js for scalability.

Key patterns:
- Modular and component-based design for frontend.
- RESTful API architecture for backend.
- Separation of concerns between presentation and data layers.
- Emphasis on maintainability and scalability.
